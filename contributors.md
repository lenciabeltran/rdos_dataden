## Acknowledging Our Collaborators

We’re so grateful to the amazing folks outside our core team who have helped shape the materials on this site. Whether by co-teaching a session, sharing lesson plans, or making their work openly available, their contributions have made these resources stronger, more diverse, and more useful for everyone.

## Guest Instructors & Collaborators <br>
Big thanks to the guest instructors and external collaborators who’ve jumped in to teach, lead activities, or co-create content with us. Your time, energy, and expertise have made a big impact.

## Open Materials & Shared Resources <br>
Many of the materials here are built on the generous work of others. We deeply appreciate those who’ve shared their teaching materials under open licenses — it’s thanks to you that we can keep building and sharing in the same spirit.


We do our best to give credit wherever it’s due. If you spot something of yours that we’ve used or adapted and don’t see your name listed — or if you’d like to be included — please **[reach out](open-scholarship@cornell.edu)**. We’d love to recognize your work.
