We are a small, yet mighty, collaborative team dedicated to supporting researchers in managing, sharing, and preserving their data and scholarship. Our group was formed about a year and a half ago to bring together expertise in research data, digital preservation, and open scholarship under one umbrella.

Our team includes:

- **Wendy Kozlowski**: our fearless Director of Research Data & Open Scholarship
- **Gabby Evergreen, Lencia McKee, and Sarah Wright**: our three data musketeers (i.e., Data Curators and Research Data Librarians), specializing in code and data management, curation, documentation, and disciplinary best practices
- **Erica Johns**: our eCommons Repository Manager extraordinaire, supporting long-term access and stewardship of digital research outputs
- **Mike Priehs**: our Open Scholarship Specialist and wearer of many hats, working in open access publishing, copyright, author rights, and responsible sharing of research

Together, we work to make research more open, reproducible, and impactful. We provide instructional support, develop tools and guidance, and collaborate with researchers across disciplines to support the full research data lifecycle.

Whether you're planning a new project, looking for guidance on documentation or metadata, preparing your data for sharing, or exploring open access options, we're here to help.
